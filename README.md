🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms – C++
This repository is a collection of DSA problems I'm solving in C++, with a focus on mastering both fundamental and advanced concepts. I'm continuously adding new problems as part of my daily grind to level up.

📁 Folder Structure
Arrays/ – Array-based problems including subarrays, sliding window, etc.
Functions_Problem Statements/ – Function-driven problems (modular C++ practice).
Patterns/ – Classic pattern printing questions.
AdditionalTopics/ – Covers programming techniques like recursion/OOPS with language focused topics and basic mathematics which is helpful in interviews.
🚀 Repo Highlights
✅ 100+ problems solved (and counting!)
✅ Classic interview questions from platforms like LeetCode, GFG, etc.
✅ Beginner-friendly and clean C++ solutions
✅ Traffic boost: 30+ unique cloners and 39 total clones (thank you, awesome people!)
📌 What's Coming Next?
I'm actively working on expanding the repo with in-depth coverage of:

🔁 Linked Lists
📚 Stacks & Queues
🛠️ Heaps & Priority Queues
🌳 Trees (BSTs, Binary Trees, Traversals)
🌐 Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
Stay tuned — it’s going to get a lot more interesting!
